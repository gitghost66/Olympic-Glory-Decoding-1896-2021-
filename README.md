# 🏅 Decoding Olympic Glory (1896–2021)

A data-driven exploration of **Olympic Games history** from **Athens 1896** to **Tokyo 2021**, uncovering trends in **medal counts**, **gender participation**, **sport diversity**, and **country performance efficiency** — complemented with a predictive model to estimate future medal tallies.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Olympic Games have been a global sporting spectacle for over a century. This project combines **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **machine learning** to:

- Explore **historical trends** in Olympic medal counts and participation.
- Investigate **gender representation** in sports over time.
- Identify **top-performing nations** and their medal efficiency.
- Build and evaluate a **predictive model** for future medal counts.

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding the dataset and extracting insights.
2. **Machine Learning Modeling** – Predicting medal counts using historical data.
